Final Project for UNA CS 470 Fall 2019
Code is super buggy, I wrote this before I knew ANYTHING about server-side programming. 
It was mainly a project to get some hands on experience using Python's AI Modules.
I was also super new to Python at the time.

Overall impression:
Good start, could go places. I feel like this code is held together with ducktape and could have used a lot more planning. 
I would implement concepts I learned in CS 455 Software Engineering to address these improvements >>>

1. Use either PHP or Node to accept inputs from user.
2. Connect this with a large dataset from maybe an online library or other source.
3. If using node (preferred), I would deploy this interface using either angular or VUE framework to make it a MEAN App.

Known Bugs:
1. Outputs to the screen are buggy and still in JSON format.
2. Does not write to JSON file properly which requires manual updates.
3. Code crashes randomly at times ^^ Connected to #2 I believe.
